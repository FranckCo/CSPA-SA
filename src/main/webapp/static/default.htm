				<p>The Common Statistical Production Architecture (CSPA) was developed during 2013 in an international collaboration project under the High-Level Group for the Modernisation of Statistical Production and Services (HLG). That project included the development and specification of the architecture, as well as a practical test of its principles and applicability in a "proof of concept". However, given the strict time limits for that project (one year), it deliberately did not include the implementation of the architecture for production systems within statistical organisations. A follow-up project to cover early implementations and the development of key supporting resources such as a catalogue of artefacts, was selected by the HLG as one of two key modernisation projects for 2014.</p>
				<p>The Seasonal Adjustment Service (SAS) is one of the CSPA services developed in the "Implementing CSPA" Project. It is a REST service wrapping the <a href="http://www.cros-portal.eu/content/jdemetra">JDemetra+</a> software.</p>
				<p>The following operations are available:</p>
				<table>
					<caption>In this table, the URI are relative, and it is assumed that 'sas' is the web context for the service.</caption>
					<thead>
						<tr><th>HTTP method</th><th>URI</th><th>Description</th></tr>
					</thead>
					<tbody>
						<tr><td>GET</td><td>/sas, /sas/ts, /sas/x13</td><td>Redirects to a HTML page describing the service (this page).</td></tr>
						<tr><td>GET</td><td>/sas/ts/{id}</td><td>Returns an XML file describing the predefined configuration {id} for Tramo-Seats.</td></tr>
						<tr><td>GET</td><td>/sas/x13/{id}</td><td>Returns an XML file describing the predefined configuration {id} for X13.</td></tr>
						<tr><td>POST</td><td>/sas/ts</td><td>Runs a Tramo-Seats analysis of a series and returns the results.</td></tr>
